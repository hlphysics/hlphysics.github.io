                    <h4>Basics</h4>
                    <p>Relativity is the study of the motion of light, and objects travelling at a fraction of the speed of light.</p>
                    <p>Physics tells us that when two observers are viewing an object, they will see that object in different places relative to their reference point. This is also true if an object is in motion. If Observer 1 is stationary and Observer 2 is moving at a constant velocity of <code>$5ms^{-1}$</code>, an object moving at a velocity of <code>$-5ms^{-1}$</code> will go at different speeds for each observer. Observer 1, whose frame of reference is still, will think the object is going at <code>$-5ms^{-1}$</code>, for Observer 2 however the object is moving at a speed of <code>$-10ms^{-1}$</code>, as the object is moving at the same time as Observer 2's frame of reference adding up the speeds.</p>

                    <h4>Time dilation</h4>
                    <p>When objects' or observers' speed gets closer to the speed of light (<code>$c$</code>), the time measured by someone going at that high speed is shorter(correct) to that of an observer(incorrect), this is where Proper time comes into play. Proper time (<code>$t_{o}$</code>) is the time measured by the high speed individual/object, while time' (<code>$t'$</code>) is time measured by a stationary observer. Time dilation tells us that both of these times are different, <code>$t'=\gammat_{o}$</code> (time' = gamma <code>$x$</code> proper time), where <code>$\gamma = \frac{1}{\root{2}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$</code>, this same equation applies for length, as an object going at high speeds seems shorter than what it really is, <code>$l'=l_{o}\gamma$</code></p>
